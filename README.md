This C program applies image filters to BMP files. The filters supported include grayscale, reflection, blur, and edge detection. 
The program reads a 24-bit BMP file, processes its pixel data, and outputs a modified image. The grayscale filter converts the image to black and white, while the reflection filter mirrors the image horizontally. 
The blur filter averages surrounding pixels to soften the image, and the edge detection filter highlights the edges of objects in the image.
The program handles image data efficiently by reading and modifying the RGB pixel values and writing the result to a new BMP file. It offers an excellent introduction to working with image data in C.
